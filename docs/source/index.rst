AgentsPy: Agent-based simulation in Python
==========================================
AgentsPy is a library for Python for doing Agent-based simulation in
education. It allows students to understand phenomenons from
e.g. biology, economics, physics, chemistry, through programming small
simulations.

AgentsPy is influenced by *NetLogo*, the Python *turtle* library, and
is currently still under development at DIKU, University of Copenhagen.

As an example, here's an epidemic simulation, that show-cases some of
the features of AgentsPy:
